Preprocessing

  - Handling Missing Values: We will assess the extent of missing data within our dataset, especially concerning player salaries and positions. Missing values will be handled using imputation techniques or by excluding records, based on the nature and extent of the missingness.
  
  - Feature Engineering: New features will be created to enhance our analysis, including inflation-adjusted salaries to account for changes in the value of money over time and aggregated statistics that may influence salaries, such as player performance indicators and team success metrics.


Methodology

  - Statistical Analysis: For examining salary trends over time and across positions, we will employ linear regression models. Significance levels will be set at 0.05, with both one-sided and two-sided analyses planned, depending on the hypothesis being tested.
  
  - Predictive Modeling Analysis: To predict future salary trends, we will split our data into training and testing sets, select algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests) based on preliminary results, and utilize cross-validation to optimize model parameters. The selection of covariates will be informed by our EDA findings.


Evaluation

  - Metrics: Our primary evaluation metrics will include R-squared for model fit and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predictive accuracy. A model with an R-squared value significantly greater than 0 and the lowest possible MAE will be considered successful.

  - Criteria: The criteria for a successful analysis include demonstrating a statistically significant trend in salaries over time (p < 0.05) and achieving an R-squared value greater than 0.7 in our predictive models, indicating a strong explanatory power.


Specific Quantifiable Goal

  Our finish line for this analysis is to identify a statistically significant increasing trend in salaries for guard positions (PG, SG) with an R-squared value greater than 0.7 in our predictive model. Achieving these benchmarks will confirm our hypothesis and indicate that our analysis has reached its goal, allowing us to move forward to the presentation preparation phase.
